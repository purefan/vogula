# PostgreSQL Manager

## Aim
I currently use PgAdmin for most postgresql management needs, but in spite of the major respect I have for the good folks behind that project I do want something a little different, so this is an attempt at coming up with a more agile tool focused on a very small set of features.

## Roadmap
The project is in its infant state and things will probably change or just die out, but so far at least this is the plan:

1. Minimal usability

	1. Have a login screen
	2. Create, update and delete connections to 1+ databases
	3. Handle connections - be able to connect/disconnect
	4. Be able to run arbitrary SQL queries
2. Extended usability

	1. SQL linter
	2. Save/Load snippets
	3. Theming - Be able to load css
