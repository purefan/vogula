It must provide the minimal interface to load anything, the bare skeleton. Everything else will be plugins, so part of the basic core functionality is the
plugin system.

The plugin system will store actions (functions), similar to express middleware. Each action will receive an object (`params`) and must return something.
The returned object of an action will be passed along to the next action in the chain.

Core Events:
- init: Triggered when the app is ready to start processing plugins. This is a good place to register the log-in screen

A plugin can trigger events. These events may trigger other plugins
Vogula uses MithrilJS, so you have to learn that if you want to make visual plugins (a popup for example).
